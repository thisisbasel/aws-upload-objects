\f0\fs24 \cf0 For the Playful Problem Solving project, we have setup an AWS S3 bucket for uploading gameplay files. We setup a few constraints in our bucket policy that allow .ini files to be uploaded, while some other file extensions will be denied (i.e. .mp4, .rtf, etc.). We\'92ve attached a .py file with the bucket credentials. The upload.py file can be run to upload files to our S3 bucket. You will have to change the \'91key\'92 and \'91data\'92 values to upload the file from a specific file path. }
